## Overview

Generate images from text descriptions using Nano Banana 2, Soul, or Seedream. Each model has different strengths.

## Quick Comparison

| Model | Speed | Best For | Credits |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| Nano Banana 2 | Fastest | Iteration, testing | 3 |
| Soul | Medium | Style consistency | 2 |
| Seedream | Slower | High resolution (4K) | 2-4 |

## Nano Banana 2

Fast, general-purpose generation.

```bash
curl -X POST https://higgsfield.ai/api/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hf_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "nano_banana_2",
    "params": {
      "prompt": "Professional headshot of a business executive, studio lighting, neutral background",
      "width": 864,
      "height": 1184,
      "batch_size": 4,
      "aspect_ratio": "3:4",
      "resolution": "2k"
    }
  }'
```

### When to Use

- Rapid iteration on prompts
- Testing composition ideas
- General purpose images
- Multiple variations (`batch_size` up to 4)

## Soul

Style-controlled generation with presets.

```bash
curl -X POST https://higgsfield.ai/api/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hf_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "text2image_soul",
    "params": {
      "prompt": "Fashion model in urban setting, confident pose",
      "quality": "1080p",
      "aspect_ratio": "3:4",
      "style_id": "your-style-uuid",
      "style_strength": 0.75,
      "enhance_prompt": true,
      "seed": 42,
      "batch_size": 2
    }
  }'
```

### When to Use

- Brand consistency
- Consistent character design
- Artistic styles
- Series of related images

## Seedream

High-resolution output up to 4K.

```bash
curl -X POST https://higgsfield.ai/api/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hf_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "seedream",
    "params": {
      "model": "seedream_v4_5",
      "prompt": "Stunning landscape, dramatic clouds, professional photography",
      "width": 2560,
      "height": 1440,
      "quality": "high",
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
      "batch_size": 1,
      "seed": 12345
    }
  }'
```

### When to Use

- Print materials
- Large displays
- High-resolution marketing
- Final production assets

## Aspect Ratios

All models support these ratios:

| Ratio | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `1:1` | Social media, avatars |
| `16:9` | YouTube, presentations |
| `9:16` | TikTok, Stories |
| `4:3` | Standard landscape |
| `3:4` | Standard portrait |
| `4:5` | Instagram portrait |
| `3:2` | Photography standard |
| `21:9` | Ultra-wide |

## Prompt Engineering

### Structure

```
[Subject], [Details], [Style], [Technical]
```

### Example

```
Professional headshot of a CEO, confident expression,
modern office background, shallow depth of field,
studio lighting, 4K, photorealistic
```

### Good Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about subject | "Something cool" |
| Include lighting details | Assume default lighting |
| Mention style or quality | Generic descriptions |
| Describe composition | Leave composition to chance |

### Useful Modifiers

**Quality:**
- "4K", "ultra HD", "high resolution"
- "photorealistic", "hyperrealistic"
- "professional", "studio quality"

**Lighting:**
- "golden hour", "blue hour"
- "studio lighting", "natural light"
- "dramatic shadows", "soft diffused"

**Composition:**
- "close-up", "wide shot", "aerial view"
- "centered", "rule of thirds"
- "shallow depth of field", "bokeh"

## Batch Generation

Generate multiple variations:

```json
{
  "type": "nano_banana_2",
  "params": {
    "prompt": "Product shot of sneakers on white background",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024,
    "batch_size": 4,
    "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
    "resolution": "2k"
  }
}
```

All variations are returned in the results.

## Using Seeds

For reproducible results:

```json
{
  "type": "text2image_soul",
  "params": {
    "prompt": "Portrait in vintage style",
    "seed": 42,
    ...
  }
}
```

Same seed + same prompt = same output.

**Tip:** Keep the seed constant while adjusting other parameters to iterate on a specific result.

## Poll for Results

```bash
curl "https://higgsfield.ai/api/jobs?id=JOB_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hf_your_api_key"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "JOB_ID",
  "type": "nano_banana_2",
  "status": "completed",
  "results": {
    "raw": {
      "type": "image",
      "url": "https://cdn.higgsfield.ai/image.png"
    }
  }
}
```

## Post-Processing

Chain with enhancement models:

```
Generate → Skin Enhancer (portraits) → Topaz Upscale (higher res)
```

### Example Pipeline

1. Generate with Nano Banana 2 (3 credits)
2. Enhance skin if portrait (1 credit)
3. Upscale 2x with Topaz (1 credit)

Total: 5 credits for enhanced, upscaled image.

## Tips

1. **Iterate fast with Nano** - Test prompts with Nano Banana before using slower models
2. **Use Soul for consistency** - When making related images, Soul keeps style constant
3. **Seedream for final** - Use high-quality Seedream for production assets
4. **Batch for options** - Generate 4 variations, pick the best
5. **Seeds for control** - Lock in a good result with a seed, then refine prompt

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Wrong composition | Be explicit about framing |
| Missing subject | Describe subject first in prompt |
| Wrong style | Add style modifiers or use Soul |
| Low quality | Use "high quality", "4K", "detailed" |
