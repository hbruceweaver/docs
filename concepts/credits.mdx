## Checking Balance

Check your credit balance in the [Dashboard](https://higgsfield.dev/dashboard).

## Failed Jobs

Failed jobs are not charged. Credits are only deducted when a job completes successfully.

## Batch Generation

Batch generation (e.g., `batch_size: 4`) charges once for the entire batch, not per image.

```json
{
  "type": "nano_banana_2",
  "params": {
    "batch_size": 4,  // 4 images
    ...
  }
}
// Cost: 3 credits (not 12)
```
