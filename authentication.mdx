## API Keys

All API requests require authentication via API key. Keys are scoped to organizations and track usage per-key.

### Key Format

API keys follow the format `hf_` followed by a random string:

```
hf_abc123def456ghi789...
```

### Using Your Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://higgsfield.ai/api/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hf_your_api_key"
```

### Creating API Keys

1. Go to the [Dashboard](https://higgsfield.dev/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a descriptive name
5. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)

### Key Security

<Warning>
API keys grant full access to your organization's resources. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

**Best practices:**

- Never commit keys to version control
- Use environment variables in your applications
- Rotate keys periodically
- Create separate keys for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Revoke unused keys promptly

### Revoking Keys

To revoke a key:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**

Revoked keys are rejected immediately. Any requests using them will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

## Error Responses

### Missing Authentication

```json
{
  "error": "Authentication required. Provide API key via Authorization: Bearer hf_..."
}
```

### Invalid Format

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid Authorization header format. Use: Bearer hf_..."
}
```

### Invalid Key

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or revoked API key"
}
```

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are applied per organization, not per key. Current limits:

| Resource | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| API requests | 1000/minute |
| Concurrent jobs | Based on plan |

Exceeding limits returns `429 Too Many Requests`.
